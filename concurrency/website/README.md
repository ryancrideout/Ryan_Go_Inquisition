# Plan
- Create a simple React Website, where everytime we do a Get call, it returns the value of a counter and increments it by one.
    - May need to implement a Docker Image for this.
- Create Go, Python, Typescript, PHP and C++(???) blocks of code that hammer the website, and then collects metrics (speed, memory usage, other metrics)
